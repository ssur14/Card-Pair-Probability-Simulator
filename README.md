# Program-3---CS010B

This C++ program simulates dealing hands of cards from a deck to calculate the probability of receiving at least one pair of cards with the same rank. Users are prompted to choose between outputting results to the console or saving them to a file. If opting for console output, the program requests the number of cards per hand and the number of simulations, then deals the specified hands from a shuffled deck, checks for pairs, and computes the probability of encountering a pair. If the user selects file output, the program performs similar operations but records each hand and pair results to the specified file. The program uses custom Deck and Card classes for card management and includes functions for detecting pairs and formatting card output.
